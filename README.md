# Weather-Station
This is a portable mini weather station which measures Temperature, Humidity and Air Quality in real time. It uses a ESP8266 micro controller, highly precise Bosch BME680 for temperature and humidity. For air quality I am using a Plantower PMS 7003 to measure PM 1.0, PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter in air. All the readings are shown in a small OLED display. The whole system is powered by a small rechargeable LiPo battery. 
Here is a Video of it in action: https://youtu.be/87MzQdXL4jI
